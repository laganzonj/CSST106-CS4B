 - Blurring: Gaussian and box filters are effective for softening images, while motion blur is used to create a dynamic or artistic streaking effect. Bilateral and median blurs provide smoother results while preserving important details.
- Noise Reduction: Median blur excels at removing noise, particularly salt-and-pepper noise, while Gaussian blur and the bilateral filter also reduce overall noise effectively.
- Edge Preservation: The bilateral filter is unique in its ability to smoothen images while preserving edges, unlike Gaussian or box filters, which blur edges as well. Median blur also maintains edges while reducing noise.
- Sharpening: Unsharp mask is the primary filter for sharpening, enhancing image details by increasing local contrast.
- Artistic Effect: Motion blur adds artistic motion effects, while Gaussian and box filters are used to create soft, dreamy aesthetics.
- Facial Enhancement: The bilateral filter is ideal for facial enhancement, smoothing skin tones while keeping key features sharp. Gaussian blur can also soften skin textures, but at the expense of some detail loss. Unsharp mask is used to bring out fine details, like eyes or hair, in portraits.
