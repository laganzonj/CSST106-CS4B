• Computer Vision is a field of artificial intelligence (AI) that enables machines to interpret and understand visual information, similar to how humans use their eyes and brains to interpret things. It involves acquiring, processing, analyzing, and understanding images or videos. It has a goal of making decisions or providing output based on that visual data. Computer Vision is crucial for applications like facial recognition, object detection, autonomous vehicles, medical imaging, and augmented reality.

•Image processing is a foundational step in computer vision that involves techniques to enhance, transform, or analyze images. image processing enhances, manipulates, and structures this data in ways that make it suitable for analysis. Without proper image processing, AI systems would struggle to handle complex visual tasks and achieve high levels of accuracy.
