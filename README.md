### Introduction to Computer Vision and Image Processing

• Computer Vision is a field of artificial intelligence (AI) that enables machines to interpret and understand visual information, similar to how humans use their eyes and brains to interpret things. It involves acquiring, processing, analyzing, and understanding images or videos. It has a goal of making decisions or providing output based on that visual data. Computer Vision is crucial for applications like facial recognition, object detection, autonomous vehicles, medical imaging, and augmented reality.

•Image processing is a foundational step in computer vision that involves techniques to enhance, transform, or analyze images. image processing enhances, manipulates, and structures this data in ways that make it suitable for analysis. Without proper image processing, AI systems would struggle to handle complex visual tasks and achieve high levels of accuracy.


### Types of Image Processing Techniques

1. Filtering, this technique involves applying a filter to an image to enhance or suppress specific features. Common filters include blurring to smooth images and sharpening to enhance details. Filtering helps in reducing noise, improving image clarity, and highlighting important features.
2. Edge detection identifies the boundaries of objects within an image by finding areas where the image intensity changes sharply. Techniques like the Canny or Sobel edge detectors are used to highlight these boundaries, which is useful for detecting shapes and structures within an image.
3. Segmentation divides an image into distinct regions or segments based on pixel values or other features. This process helps in isolating objects or areas of interest within an image, making it easier to analyze and process specific parts of the image separately. Segmentation is commonly used in object recognition and image analysis tasks.


### Case Study Overview: Facial Recognition Systems
#### Application

  Facial recognition systems are widely used for identity verification and security, ranging from unlocking smartphones to surveillance systems in public places. These systems utilize computer vision techniques to identify and verify individuals based on their facial features.


##### Challenges 
 Variability in Lighting and Backgrounds. Ensures that variations in lighting and backgrounds do not affect the recognition accuracy.

 Blur and Noise Introduction: acquired images that are blurred or noisy. Blur can occur due to movement or poor focus, and noise can be introduced by low-quality sensors or environmental factors. These issues can degrade recognition performance and make it harder to accurately identify faces.
