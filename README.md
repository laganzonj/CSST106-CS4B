## Machine Problem No. 1: Exploring the Role of Computer Vision and Image Processing in AI

## [VIEW MP1 README](https://github.com/laganzonj/CSST106-CS4B/blob/305b26da05fafe38f202760bb481c97b1a43a430/4B-LAGANZON-MP1/README.md)

 • Computer Vision is a field of artificial intelligence (AI) that enables machines to interpret and understand visual information, similar to how humans use their eyes and brains to interpret things. It involves acquiring, processing, analyzing, and understanding images or videos. It has a goal of making decisions or providing output based on that visual data. Computer Vision is crucial for applications like facial recognition, object detection, autonomous vehicles, medical imaging, and augmented reality.

 • Image processing is a foundational step in computer vision that involves techniques to enhance, transform, or analyze images. image processing enhances, manipulates, and structures this data in ways that make it suitable for analysis. Without proper image processing, AI systems would struggle to handle complex visual tasks and achieve high levels of accuracy.



## Machine Problem No. 2: Applying Image Processing Techniques

## [VIEW MP2 README](https://github.com/laganzonj/CSST106-CS4B/blob/03c043a9da8b67dd630dbdf4a2699bdcf655b75d/4B-LAGANZON-MP2/README.md)

### Image Processing Techniques

- Scaling
- Rotation
- Blurring
- Edge Detection


### Main Libraries Used

### cv2 (OpenCV):

cv2 is a Python module that lets you use OpenCV, a powerful tool for working with images and videos. It helps you do tasks like:

- Reading, writing, and displaying images/videos (e.g., `cv2.imread()`, `cv2.imwrite()`, `cv2.imshow()`)
- Image transformations (e.g., resizing, rotation, scaling)
- Filters (e.g., blurring, edge detection)
- Object detection (e.g., face detection)
- Feature extraction (e.g., corner detection, template matching)



### numpy (imported as np):

numpy is a Python library that helps you work with large sets of numbers arranged in grids (like tables or images). It allows you to:

- Images are often represented as arrays of pixel values (e.g., 2D arrays for grayscale images, 3D arrays for color images).
- Numpy allows for efficient manipulation of these arrays, including transformations, filtering, and mathematical operations.
