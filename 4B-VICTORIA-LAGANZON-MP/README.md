## üîç About the Models

### HOG-SVM
The **Histogram of Oriented Gradients** (HOG) with **Support Vector Machine** (SVM) is used for object detection. HOG is particularly effective in capturing the structure and appearance of objects. By combining it with SVM, a robust classification of objects is achieved.

**Evaluation**:  
HOG-SVM proved effective in scenarios with simpler, more structured environments. Its reliance on handcrafted features, like edge orientation gradients, allowed it to classify specific, well-defined objects with reasonable accuracy while requiring minimal computational resources. However, it faced limitations with multi-scale detection, complex backgrounds, and generalization, which reduced its robustness in real-world settings with diverse object appearances and complex scenes.

### YOLO
**You Only Look Once** (YOLO) is an advanced deep-learning model for real-time object detection. Its speed and accuracy make it ideal for applications requiring immediate detection.

**Evaluation**:  
YOLOv5 showcased its strengths in real-time, multi-object detection across various environments. Leveraging deep learning and a one-shot detection framework, YOLOv5 achieved high accuracy and robustness, performing well in detecting multiple object classes even within cluttered and challenging backgrounds. While the model required extensive computational power, increasing training time, its versatility and efficiency in real-world applications, like surveillance and autonomous navigation, were evident.
